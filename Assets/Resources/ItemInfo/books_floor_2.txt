Do you like him, my mother asked me when she was picking out her wedding dress. I liked him well enough, though he often made a secret of his love for us.

Five, six, seven, eight––she kicks her leg up into the air. Hold it––from the top of the pyramid, she smiles at me, and her hair catches the sunlight. Honey. Headlights on a dark road. I didn’t stop for her. I stuffed my bag with canned peaches and got the hell out...

Birds in a Prison
Blinded by their conceptions, men might think me a simple creature––so I find myself adrift between the realm of men and that of my fellow birds, who spend their days screeching and clawing at glass, begging the mercy of an indifferent God.

All of Politics
Hyperbole - I was going to sit down and write this really comprehensive political treatise, but I have realized that every single politic is horseshit, and this is what it boils down to: there is no god.
