Gertrude's Troubles
The wind had been restless all evening; raindrops had pounded the window-panes like tiny fists. Gertrude had slept, albeit fitfully––she had watched the fire’s embers slowly die between each slumber...

War of Weekends
I hadn’t been planning to fall in love this summer––but I hadn’t been planning on fighting in Jimmy’s war, either. The day it started, Truck Gordon had been lying in wait in the reeds on the riverbank with his jeans rolled up to his knees. He’d been filling a glass jar with tadpoles and holding them up to the sunlight to watch them swim, like a curious god...

Abrasion 
When I was young, I always chafed. My childhood years were typified by chapped thighs. I tried everything––deodorant, spandex, baby powder. My earliest sexual experiences were similarly grating, and lubricants did little to alleviate the issue. I thought I’d never escape the grind––until I walked into Judd’s car wash...

Augmented Triads
The idea came to Dr. Proudsnout Bitterwing as he was standing in the animal shelter in search of a companion for his son. All week, the shelter was posting photos of a three-legged cat on its social media page––now the creature was staring up at him with wide eyes. Six months later, Bitterwing was taking custody of nearly four dozen disabled cats, each promising to advance the research that was fast-becoming his life’s work...

Balloon Techniques
I’m standing in the midst of a crowd of eight-year-olds, each demanding an increasingly bizarre and complex balloon. Pulling this off is going to take grit, determination, and a whole lot of...

Rambunctious Children
Soon your children will have dismantled the baby gate at the top of the stairs. They’ll have tumbled down the steps one by one and left a trail of sticky pawprints from the Jack & Jill bathroom to the pantry, where they’ll have jimmied the child-safe doorknob and, stacked precariously upon one another’s shoulders, extracted their prize from the top shelf––the stash of W*lmart Halloween candy. In a few moments, they’ll have devoured their treasure, and you’ll have found them lounging on the linoleum in perfect contentment, like a herd of seals...

The Suspected Odyssey
Perhaps one day the people will have been toiling under the weight of this darkness long enough. Surely on that day, the gods will have already been training up a chosen One to free our people of this otherworldly curse...
