Gertrude's Troubles
The wind had been restless all evening; raindrops had pounded the window-panes like tiny fists. Gertrude had slept, albeit fitfully––she had watched the fire’s embers slowly die between each slumber...

War of Weekends
I’d never imagined I could be one of those girls who falls in love with some boy one summer––but before Truck, I’d never have played along with Jimmy’s war, either. That first weekend, the first in June, Truck Gordon had been lying in wait in the reeds on the riverbank with his jeans rolled up to his knees. He’d been filling a glass jar with tadpoles and holding them up to the light to watch them swim, godlike in the sun...

Abrasion 
FOREWORD                       When I was young, I always chafed. My childhood years were typified by chapped thighs. I tried everything––deodorant, spandex, baby powder. My earliest sexual experiences were similarly grating, and lubricants did little to alleviate the issue. I thought I’d never escape the grind––until I walked into Judd’s car wash...

Augmented Triads
One ordinary morning, Dr. Proudsnout Bitterwing was standing in an animal shelter in search of a companion for his son, oblivious to the fact that his new life was beginning. He was examining a photo of a three-legged cat from the shelter’s social media page––the same creature was staring up at him with wide eyes. Six months later, Bitterwing was studying the musical potential of nearly four dozen three-legged cats...

Waning Age 
The sun has set on your life. In the east, the moon has risen. Across the millenia, countless intelligent creatures have faced the abyss ahead––but for us whose heartbeats have surrendered in ages past, life’s final transition has always been especially bittersweet. I have walked this Earth centuries enough to have courted death. Here, I have assembled the wisdom of ancients and contemporaries. May it ease the coming sleep...

The Torturer
“You sure this is the right    place?” the driver says.        I step out onto the sidewalk.   I’m sure. Despite the years,   the place is just as I left it. People may think themselves capable of naming this world’s evils––the politician, the hustler, the debt collector––but to do so ignores the truth that the Torturer lurks among us.        It isn’t much of a house anymore. It looks more like the epicenter of an explosion. I wonder what the neighbors think––if they only knew...

Balloon Techniques
Most Saturday mornings, I’m standing in the midst of a crowd of eight-year-olds.

Like the operating theater, the birthday party is a blaring...

Rambunctious Children
Soon your children will have dismantled the baby gate and tumbled down the stairs. They’ll have tracked sticky pawprints all the way to the pantry, where they’ll have jimmied the child-safe doorknob and, stacked upon each other’s shoulders, extracted their prize from the top shelf––the cake for Sue’s baby shower. In an instant, they’ll have devoured it, and you’ll have found them lounging on the linoleum in perfect contentment, like a herd of seals...

Slapstick
My father might’ve brought me to ball games, but he wasn’t that type of man––that’s what they whispered at the wedding. How’s she gonna feed that boy as a comedian’s wife? Do you like him, my mother asked me while she picked out her wedding dress. I liked him well enough, though he made a secret of his love for us. Before he came along, we only knew the love of another man’s belt. My father had none of that type of love in him––he wasn’t that type of man, either...

How to Commune with The God
I set out to write this book with the intention of composing a treatise on worship for English speakers.

In this book, I hope to reassure you that there is hope, and to set you on the path toward salvation...

Spilling Her Guts
Day 41                         Supply run to the high school. Saw her again, shambling between the cafeteria tables––graceful somehow, despite the emptiness in her eyes. Afternoon cheer practice. Five, six, seven, eight––she kicks her leg up into the air. Hold. From the top of the pyramid, she smiles at me, and her hair catches the sunlight. Honey. Headlights on a dark road. I didn’t stop for her. I stuffed my bag with canned peaches and got the hell out...

Birds in a Prison
Blinded by their conceptions, men might think me a simple creature––so I find myself adrift between the realm of men and that of my fellow birds, who spend their days screeching and clawing at glass, begging the mercy of an indifferent God.

Tracing the X
Historians, artisans, conspiracy theorists, and fortune-tellers alike have sought to identify the anonymous calligrapher known as X. This book owes much of its success to those thinkers.

In this book, I present my argument for X’s identity by tracing their ex through history...

Everything goes silent and black as the grave, and I stare at the instruments on the dashboard and the stars past it. They blink and flicker, and I feel as I did on Earth when I stood on the beach and stared out at the gray horizon line. Forever––that’s how long the ocean is...

The art of trick-taking dates back to the advent of the card deck some thousand years ago. The first card games were trick-taking games.

Siberian Camps, Frigid Temperatures
TAYMYR PENINSULA - In the sub-zero black of an arctic winter, the air is a living thing. It claws at the lungs, thirsty for warmth. It sears across the tundra. Every inhalation is a bruise; the condensation of each exhalation freezes to the eyelashes and eyebrows. Blink, and the eyes freeze shut. In such climes it is essential to limit exposure to the elements to the greatest extent possible. The matter is complicated when one is in the wilderness...

In an instant, the night sky had turned into the notes of an ancient song.                 Ever since Riley learned to count, numbers had spoken to her. Actually, they never shut up.

This collection of high-resolution photographs illuminates how his work was informed by his identity as one of history’s first simps...

Grapefruits v. Pickles
