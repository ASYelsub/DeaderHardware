Gertrude's Troubles
The wind had been restless all evening; raindrops had pounded the window-panes like tiny fists. Gertrude had slept, albeit fitfully––she had watched the fire’s embers slowly die between each slumber...

War of Weekends
I hadn’t been planning to fall in love this summer––but I hadn’t been planning on fighting in Jimmy’s war, either. The day it started, Truck Gordon had been lying in wait in the reeds on the riverbank with his jeans rolled up to his knees. He’d been filling a glass jar with tadpoles and holding them up to the sunlight to watch them swim, like a curious god...

Abrasion 
When I was young, I always chafed. My childhood years were typified by chapped thighs. I tried everything––deodorant, spandex, baby powder. My earliest sexual experiences were similarly grating, and lubricants did little to alleviate the issue. I thought I’d never escape the grind––until I walked into Judd’s car wash...

Augmented Triads
The idea came to Dr. Proudsnout Bitterwing as he was standing in the animal shelter in search of a companion for his son. All week, the shelter was posting photos of a three-legged cat on its social media page––now the creature was staring up at him with wide eyes. Six months later, Bitterwing was taking custody of nearly four dozen disabled cats, each promising to advance the research that was fast-becoming his life’s work...

Waning Age 
The sun has set on your life. In the east, the moon has risen. Across the ages, countless intelligent creatures have faced the black unknown ahead––but for those of us who have already breathed our final breaths in aeons past, life’s final transition has always been especially bittersweet. I have walked this Earth centuries enough to have courted death. I have assembled the wisdom of ancients and contemporaries herein, to ease your dissolution into the fabric of the universe...

Rambunctious Children
Soon your children will have dismantled the baby gate at the top of the stairs. They’ll have tumbled down the steps one by one and left a trail of sticky pawprints from the Jack & Jill bathroom to the pantry, where they’ll have jimmied the child-safe doorknob and, stacked precariously upon one another’s shoulders, extracted their prize from the top shelf––the stash of W*lmart Halloween candy. In a few moments, they’ll have devoured their treasure, and you’ll have found them lounging on the linoleum in perfect contentment, like a herd of seals...

Slapstick
My father might have brought me to ball games, but he wasn’t that type of man. That’s what they whispered at the wedding, just loud enough to hear––how’s she gonna feed that boy as a comedian’s wife? Do you like him, my mother asked me when she was picking out her wedding dress. I liked him well enough, though he often made a secret of his love for us. Before he came along, my mother and I knew the love of another man’s belt. I could tell already he had none of that type of love in him. He wasn’t that type of man, either...

How to Commune with The God
I set out to write this book with the intention of composing a treatise on worship for English speakers. In the course of my research, I discovered a group with a far greater need for guidance––the animal. This book is written for you. I see in your eyes the desire to worship; I see in your hooves the inability to do so in the manner of your hairless brethren. In this book, I hope to reassure you that there is hope, and to set you on the path toward salvation...

Archaic Rhymes
Poetry is the most noble form of composition. It is the slow morning that follows a summer storm; it is correspondence with the hollow in the human soul. In this compendium of history’s most notable slam poems, I propose to expound on the form’s origins in oral storytelling performances of old...

Spilling Her Guts
Supply run to the high school. Saw her again. She was shambling between the tables, graceful despite the emptiness in her eyes. Afternoon cheer practice. Five, six, seven, eight––she kicks her leg up into the air. Hold it––from the top of the pyramid, she smiles at me, and her hair catches the sunlight. Honey. Headlights on a dark road. I didn’t stop for her. I stuffed my bag with canned peaches and got the hell out...
