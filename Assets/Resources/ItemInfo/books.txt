War of Weekends
I hadn’t been planning to fall in love this summer––but I hadn’t been planning on fighting in Jimmy’s war, either. The day it started, Truck Gordon had been lying in wait in the reeds on the riverbank with his jeans rolled up to his knees. He’d been filling a glass jar with tadpoles and holding them up to the sunlight to watch them swim, like a curious god...

Abrasion 
FOREWORD                       When I was young, I always chafed. My childhood years were typified by chapped thighs. I tried everything––deodorant, spandex, baby powder. My earliest sexual experiences were similarly grating, and lubricants did little to alleviate the issue. I thought I’d never escape the grind––until I walked into Judd’s car wash...

Augmented Triads
The idea came to Dr. Proudsnout Bitterwing as he was standing in the animal shelter in search of a companion for his son. All week, the shelter was posting photos of a three-legged cat on its social media page––now the creature was staring up at him with wide eyes. Six months later, Bitterwing was taking custody of nearly four dozen disabled cats, each promising to advance the research that was fast-becoming his life’s work...

Waning Age 
The sun has set on your life. In the east, the moon has risen.

I have walked this Earth centuries enough to have courted death. I have assembled here the wisdom of ancients and contemporaries. May it ease your reckoning with the coming sleep...
