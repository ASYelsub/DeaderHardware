You! How did you get up here?
Poor thing. I'm afraid I can't help you. I'm getting ready for bridge night.
Each and every week, the girls keep beating me at bridge. 
We've all lost so much, getting old. If I could hold onto one thing from my youth...
It would be the look on their faces––ha––when I mercilessly destroyed them at bridge...
But it was all thanks to a library book on trick-taking strategy––one I've since lost...
I haven't the faintest idea where it is. You kids have––ha ha––come up with all kinds of––ha––devices. 
Pardon me. These bones... ha––
I can't say why they still have me at this job, at my age. I couldn't tell you. 
I'm too old––hah!––can't find a damn thing!
Would you be a dear and fetch me my bridge book? <CMD>
