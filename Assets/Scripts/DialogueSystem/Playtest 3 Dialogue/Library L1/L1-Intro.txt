The library's closed, but if you return during business hours––oh. It's you.
Look. You can't go upstairs. The answer is the same no matter how many times you come back.
Every time someone goes upstairs, the console has to load all the books up there.
You can only go up there if you're reshelving or loaning something. It's library policy. 
We haven't loaned a book in years. We just don't have the equipment anymore.
I'll tell you what––there's a book I've been dying to read for years now.
We're so short-staffed, I can't leave the front desk. 
If you bring me that book, maybe I can forget to guard the stairs––just this once.
The book I'm looking for is written in the future perfect tense.<CMD>
